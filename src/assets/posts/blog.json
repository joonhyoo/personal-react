I'm thinking in future I'll write my posts in a local text file and then have a js function to convert it into this json format and auto id and timestamp it for me.",

It's been an interesting time so far as a student, I've learnt lots and have aims to do even better next term than I did this time round. I'm hoping to invest more time to be curious and come out of it being able to apply the new techniques I've learnt to my own projects like GymDolphin and others that are in the planning stages.\n In terms of concrete goals, I'd like to HD both and also directly use what I've learnt.",
